Here are stored the SLIPNEAR solutions triggered when a Moment Tensor (MT) solution appears on the USGS webpage for a large enough earthquake

Results are stored in sub-directories named YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_MwX.X where YYYYMMDDHHMMSS is the origin time of the earthquake in UTC and X.X is the 
moment magnitude found by the SLIPNEAR inversion

Only results that meet quality and robustness criteria are stored here. For example, if the confidence on the slipmap of a nodal plane is lower than
70% it will not be shown.

List of files per event:

---------------------------------
model_SRFv2_average1: kinematic fault model in SRF format (Graves v2.0) for nodal planes 1 of the focal mechanism (can be the rupture plane or the auxiliary plane)
model_SRFv2_average2: kinematic fault model in SRF format (Graves v2.0) for nodal planes 2 of the focal mechanism (can be the rupture plane or the auxiliary plane)
---------------------------------

disloc_model_average1: kinematic fault model in B. Delouis format for nodal planes 1 of the focal mechanism (can be the rupture plane or the auxiliary plane)
disloc_model_average2: kinematic fault model in B. Delouis format for nodal planes 2 of the focal mechanism (can be the rupture plane or the auxiliary plane)

----------------------------------
result_complete_average1.jpg: graphical result file for nodal planes 1 of the focal mechanism (can be the rupture plane or the auxiliary plane)
result_complete_average2.jpg: graphical result file for nodal planes 2 of the focal mechanism (can be the rupture plane or the auxiliary plane)
----------------------------------

result_slipinv_average1: text result file for nodal planes 1 of the focal mechanism (can be the rupture plane or the auxiliary plane)
result_slipinv_average2: text result file for nodal planes 2 of the focal mechanism (can be the rupture plane or the auxiliary plane)
shear 
---------------------------------
summary_confidence.txt: summary of the confidence indexes and of some parameters for each nodal plane, report on the discrimination of the
rupture and auxiliary planes
Example:
                321.0  84.0  -171.0 :strike dip rake of rupture plane
                230.1  81.0    -6.1 :strike dip rake of auxiliary plane

                 34. : confidence (%) on discrimination of rupture plane
means that nodal plane 321.0  84.0  -171.0 is identified as the fault plane with a confidence of 34%, i.e. with a low probability.
The threshold for reliable disrimination is 70% of confidence.
--------------------------------

displacement_xN_yE_Zup_lat_lon_average1.txt: surface displacement values (cm) produced by the slip model on nodal plane 1 (can be the rupture plane or the auxiliary plane)
displacement_xN_yE_Zup_lat_lon_average2.txt: surface displacement values (cm) produced by the slip model on nodal plane 2 (can be the rupture plane or the auxiliary plane)
The content is  'Lat    Lon    Disp_x_East(cm)   Disp_y_North(cm)   DispUp(cm)' for a grid of points in the rupture area. Grid spacing is a function of earthquake magnitude (about 10k points).
---------------------------------

model_vel: velocity model used to generate the synthetic seismograms. Note that this model is not used to infer the mu (shear modulus) to be used to convert 
seismic moment into slip in the inversion. Instead, a constant value of mu is used for that conversion, assuming an homogenized fault zone (see description is
the kinematic fault model files)
