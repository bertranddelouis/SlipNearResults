Here are stored the SLIPNEAR solutions triggered when a Moment Tensor (MT) solution appears on the USGS webpage for a large enough earthquake

Results are stored in sub-directories named YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_MwX.X where YYYYMMDDHHMMSS is the origin time of the earthquake in UTC and X.X is the 
moment magnitude found by the SLIPNEAR inversion

Only results that meet quality and robustness criteria are stored here.
